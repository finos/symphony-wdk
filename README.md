# Symphony Workflow Developer Kit (WDK) - Beta

ðŸ“º [Video introduction of the WDK](https://goto.symphony.com/WorkflowDevKit-Recording.html)

The Symphony Workflow Developer Kit (WDK) is a way to build bots on the Symphony platform with minimal coding efforts. A
standard execution engine, provided as a bot is running workflows written in a declarative manner.

*The WDK is provided as an experimental beta-test*

Workflow executions are triggered by events (such [Real-Time Events](https://docs.developers.symphony.com/building-bots-on-symphony/datafeed/real-time-events)) and run activities. Activities are small building
blocks often calling REST API endpoints of the Symphony platform or can even be custom-made to tailor your needs.
